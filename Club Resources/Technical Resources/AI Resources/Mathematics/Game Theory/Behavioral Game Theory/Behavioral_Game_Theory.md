# Behavioral Game Theory

## Introduction
**Behavioral Game Theory** is a field that seeks to improve the explanatory and predictive power of classical game theory by incorporating insights from psychology and experimental economics. While traditional game theory is a deductive discipline based on the axiom of perfect rationality, behavioral game theory is an inductive field that starts with **empirical evidence** of how real people behave in strategic situations. It then builds more realistic models that account for cognitive limitations, social preferences, and emotions.

## The Limits of Classical Game Theory
Classical game theory is built upon the assumption of *homo economicus*—a perfectly rational, purely self-interested agent with unlimited cognitive capacity. However, when simple games are played in laboratory experiments, people consistently and systematically deviate from the predictions of this model. Behavioral game theory aims to explain these deviations.

## The Core Principles of Behavioral Game Theory
This field enriches the classical model by relaxing its strict assumptions and incorporating more psychologically realistic factors.

### 1. Bounded Rationality
Instead of perfect rationality, behavioral game theory assumes that players have **bounded rationality**. This means their decision-making is constrained by:
-   **Limited Cognitive Capacity**: People cannot analyze infinitely complex problems and instead rely on mental shortcuts or **heuristics**.
-   **Limited Information**: Players often act on incomplete information.
-   **Satisficing**: Players often search for a solution that is "good enough" (**satisficing**) rather than the absolute best (**optimizing**).

### 2. Social Preferences (Other-Regarding Utility)
A central finding is that a person's utility is not just a function of their own monetary payoff. People are often motivated by **social preferences**.
-   **Fairness and Inequity Aversion**: People have an innate sense of fairness and experience disutility from unequal outcomes. They may prefer a more equal distribution of rewards, even if it means a smaller personal payoff.
-   **Reciprocity**: People have a tendency to respond to others' actions in kind.
    -   **Positive Reciprocity**: Rewarding kind or cooperative behavior.
    -   **Negative Reciprocity**: Punishing unkind or unfair behavior, even at a personal cost.
-   **Altruism**: People may derive utility from the well-being of others, leading them to act in ways that are not purely self-interested.

### 3. Learning
Instead of deducing the optimal strategy from the start, players often learn and adapt their behavior over time based on the outcomes of previous rounds of a game.

## Evidence from Classic Experiments

### The Ultimatum Game
This game is the cornerstone of behavioral game theory.
-   **The "Rational" Prediction**: A self-interested Proposer should offer the smallest possible non-zero amount, and a self-interested Responder should accept it.
-   **The Behavioral Finding**: Proposers typically offer a substantial share (often 40-50%), and Responders frequently **reject** offers they perceive as unfair (typically below 20-30%).
-   **The Implication**: This demonstrates the power of **fairness** and **negative reciprocity**. Responders are willing to pay a price (getting $0) to punish a Proposer for an unfair action.

### The Dictator Game
This is a control for the Ultimatum Game. The Proposer ("Dictator") decides on a split, and the Responder has no power to reject it.
-   **The "Rational" Prediction**: The Dictator should keep 100% of the money.
-   **The Behavioral Finding**: Dictators often give a non-zero amount (typically around 20%).
-   **The Implication**: This reveals the presence of pure **altruism**, as there is no strategic fear of rejection.

### The Trust Game
This game measures trust and positive reciprocity. An Investor can send money to a Trustee. The amount is tripled. The Trustee can then choose to send some, all, or none of the money back. It shows that people are often willing to trust strangers, and that this trust is often (though not always) rewarded through reciprocity.

## Key Models in Behavioral Game Theory
To formalize these observations, new models have been developed:
-   **Inequity Aversion Models (e.g., Fehr-Schmidt model)**: These models explicitly add terms to a player's utility function that represent their dislike for unequal outcomes.
-   **Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE)**: This model relaxes the "best response" assumption. Instead of always choosing their best response, players choose better responses with higher probability, allowing for "noisy" or imperfect decision-making.

## Applications
1.  **Economics**: Behavioral game theory provides more accurate models for bargaining, negotiations, and social dilemmas. It helps explain wage rigidity, market anomalies, and the importance of social norms in economic transactions.
2.  **Machine Learning**: For designing AI agents that need to interact with humans. An AI that understands social preferences like fairness will be more successful in cooperative tasks.
3.  **Public Policy**: Understanding cognitive biases and social preferences helps in designing better policies ("nudges") that encourage prosocial behavior, such as saving for retirement or conserving energy.
4.  **Law**: Provides insights into contract law and torts by modeling how people perceive fairness and respond to breaches of trust.
