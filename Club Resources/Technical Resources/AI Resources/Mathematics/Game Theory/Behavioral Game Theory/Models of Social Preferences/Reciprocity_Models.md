# Reciprocity Models

## Introduction
**Reciprocity** is a powerful social preference that describes the human tendency to respond to the perceived intentions of others in kind. In behavioral game theory, reciprocity models explore how individuals are motivated not just by final outcomes, but by the kindness or unkindness of the actions that lead to those outcomes. This provides a crucial framework for understanding why people reward cooperation and punish unfairness, even at a personal cost. By incorporating intentions into the analysis, these models offer a more psychologically realistic and accurate explanation of human strategic behavior than models based on pure self-interest or simple inequity aversion.

## The Psychology of Reciprocity: Intentions Matter
Reciprocity models are distinct from other social preference models because they focus on the **process** of an interaction, not just the final distribution of payoffs.

There are two key types of reciprocity:
1.  **Positive Reciprocity**: The tendency to be kind to those who are perceived as being kind. Individuals are often willing to sacrifice their own resources to reward someone who has helped them or shown trust.
2.  **Negative Reciprocity**: The tendency to be unkind to those who are perceived as being unkind. Individuals are willing to incur a personal cost to punish someone who has acted unfairly or hostilely.

This focus on intentions is critical. For example, people are much more likely to punish an unfair ($8, $2) split in an Ultimatum Game if it was chosen by a human Proposer than if the same split was generated by a random computer draw. The unequal outcome is the same, but the perceived hostile *intention* is absent in the second case.

## Evidence from Classic Economic Games
The effects of reciprocity are most clearly demonstrated in simple laboratory experiments.

### The Trust Game (Evidence for Positive Reciprocity)
-   **Setup**: An "Investor" (Player 1) is given a sum of money, say $10. They can choose to send any portion of it to a "Trustee" (Player 2). The amount sent is tripled by the experimenter. The Trustee then decides how much of this tripled amount to return to the Investor.
-   **"Rational" Prediction**: A self-interested Trustee will never return any money. The Investor, anticipating this, will never send any money in the first place.
-   **Behavioral Finding**: Investors frequently send a significant amount of money, demonstrating **trust**. Trustees often return a positive amount, demonstrating **positive reciprocity** by rewarding the Investor's trust, even though they could keep the entire sum.

### The Ultimatum Game (Evidence for Negative Reciprocity)
-   **Setup**: A "Proposer" offers a split of a sum of money to a "Responder." The Responder can either accept the split or reject it, in which case both players get nothing.
-   **"Rational" Prediction**: A self-interested Responder should accept any non-zero offer.
-   **Behavioral Finding**: Responders frequently **reject** low, "unfair" offers.
-   **Implication**: This is a classic act of **negative reciprocity**. The Responder is willing to pay a price (receiving $0 instead of a small positive amount) to punish the Proposer for the perceived unkindness of making an unfair offer.

## Formalizing Reciprocity: A Conceptual Overview
Sophisticated models, such as **Rabin's Fairness Equilibrium**, formalize this concept by modifying players' utility functions. In these models, a player's utility is a combination of two components:

1.  **Material Payoff**: The player's own direct, selfish gain.
2.  **Psychological Payoff**: This part depends on the player's own "kindness" and their *belief* about the other player's "kindness".
    -   Players get positive utility from matching kindness with kindness (positive reciprocity).
    -   Players also get positive utility from matching unkindness with unkindness (negative reciprocity).

This framework mathematically captures the idea that people feel good about rewarding cooperation and punishing defection.

## Applications
1.  **Economics**: Reciprocity models explain many real-world economic phenomena that defy simple self-interest models.
    -   **Labor Markets**: Why employers might pay "efficiency wages" (wages above the market-clearing rate). A high wage is perceived as a kind act, which workers may reciprocate with high effort.
    -   **Contract Enforcement**: Explains why informal agreements and social norms, upheld by the threat of reciprocal punishment, can be as effective as formal, legal contracts.
2.  **Machine Learning and AI**: For designing AI agents that can successfully cooperate and negotiate with humans. An AI that understands and exhibits reciprocity will be more trusted and can build more effective long-term partnerships.
3.  **Law and Social Policy**: Provides a basis for understanding why people are willing to fund a costly legal system to punish wrongdoers (negative reciprocity) and why social programs that encourage mutual responsibility can be effective.
4.  **Evolutionary Biology**: To model the evolution of cooperation in species. Reciprocal altruism ("you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours") can be a stable evolutionary strategy.
