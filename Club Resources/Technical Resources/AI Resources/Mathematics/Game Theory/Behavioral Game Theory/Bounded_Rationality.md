# Bounded Rationality

## Introduction
**Bounded rationality** is a concept that provides a more realistic model of human decision-making than the classical assumption of perfect, unlimited rationality. Pioneered by Nobel laureate Herbert A. Simon, this framework acknowledges that the ability of humans to make "optimal" decisions is fundamentally constrained or "bounded" by their cognitive limitations. In game theory, this concept is central to the field of **behavioral game theory**, which seeks to explain why the behavior of real people in strategic situations often deviates from the predictions of classical models.

## The Limits of Perfect Rationality
Classical game theory and economics are built upon the model of *homo economicus*—a perfectly rational agent. This agent is assumed to have:
-   Perfect and complete information about the problem.
-   Unlimited cognitive capacity to calculate the consequences of every possible choice.
-   Unlimited time to make a decision.
-   A single goal: to choose the option that maximizes their own utility.

Bounded rationality argues that this is an unrealistic idealization. Real human decision-making is constrained by:
1.  **Limited Information**: We rarely have access to all the facts.
2.  **Cognitive Limitations**: Our brains have finite memory and processing power. We cannot analyze every possible outcome in a complex game like chess.
3.  **Limited Time**: Many decisions must be made under time pressure.

## Consequences of Bounded Rationality

### 1. Satisficing, Not Optimizing
This is the key behavioral consequence identified by Simon. Because finding the absolute best (optimal) solution is often impossible or impractical, people do not **optimize**. Instead, they **satisfice**.
-   **Satisficing**: A decision-making strategy that aims for a satisfactory or "good enough" result, rather than the optimal one. A person will search for options and stop as soon as they find one that meets their **aspiration level**.
-   *Example*: When buying a car, you don't research every single car model in the world to find the perfect one. You search until you find a car that is good enough for your needs and budget, and then you stop looking.

### 2. Heuristics and Cognitive Biases
To cope with a complex world and their cognitive limits, people rely on **heuristics**, which are mental shortcuts or rules of thumb. While these shortcuts are often efficient and effective, they can also lead to systematic and predictable errors in judgment, known as **cognitive biases**.
-   **Availability Heuristic**: Judging the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples come to mind (e.g., overestimating the risk of a plane crash after seeing news reports).
-   **Anchoring**: Over-relying on the first piece of information received when making a decision (e.g., an initial price quoted in a negotiation).

## Bounded Rationality in Game Theory
Bounded rationality provides a powerful explanation for why the predictions of classical game theory often fail in laboratory experiments.

-   **Example 1: The Ultimatum Game**
    -   *Prediction of Perfect Rationality*: The Proposer should offer the smallest possible non-zero amount, and the Responder should accept it (as something is better than nothing).
    -   *Actual Behavior*: Proposers make much fairer offers (often 50/50), and Responders frequently reject offers they perceive as unfair. This is because human utility is bounded by social preferences for fairness and a willingness to punish perceived slights, factors the simple model ignores.

-   **Example 2: The Centipede Game**
    -   *Prediction of Perfect Rationality*: The first player should defect on the very first move. This relies on a long, fragile chain of backward induction logic.
    -   *Actual Behavior*: Players almost always cooperate for several rounds. This suggests that people are either unable to compute the full backward induction or are unwilling to trust that their opponent is a perfectly rational, backward-inducing agent.

## Applications
-   **Behavioral Economics**: Bounded rationality is the foundational concept of this entire field, which uses psychological insights to build more realistic models of economic behavior, explaining everything from consumer choice to stock market bubbles.
-   **Artificial Intelligence**: The concept of **resource-rationality** in AI is a direct application. An AI agent with limited computational resources (time, memory) should not try to find the perfect solution, but rather the best solution it can find *given its constraints*.
-   **Management and Organizational Science**: Explains how large organizations make decisions. Rather than a single "optimal" decision, organizations often arrive at a satisfactory compromise through a series of local, heuristic-based choices.
-   **Public Policy**: Understanding cognitive biases allows policymakers to design "nudges" and choice architectures that help people make better decisions regarding their health, finances, and well-being.

## Conclusion
Bounded rationality does not suggest that people are irrational. Instead, it provides a more psychologically grounded and realistic model of human intelligence. It posits that humans behave in a manner that is "procedurally rational"—they make the best decisions they can using simple heuristics and incomplete information, given the cognitive limitations they face. This framework is essential for explaining and predicting how people actually behave in complex strategic situations.
