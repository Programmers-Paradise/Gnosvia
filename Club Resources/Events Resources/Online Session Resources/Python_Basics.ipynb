    "### Features of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is often called a \"batteries-included\" language. Here are its standout features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple & Easy to Learn: Python mimics human language. It strips away the complex syntax (like curly braces {} or semi-colons ;) found in languages like C++ or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line-by-line. This makes debugging easy because the program stops immediately when it hits an error, showing you exactly where it failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamically Typed: You don’t need to declare variable types. Python figures out that x = 10 is an integer and name = \"Sam\" is a string automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Object-Oriented: It supports concepts like Classes and Objects (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism), which helps in building manageable and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Huge Standard Library: Python has massive built-in support for almost anything—from connecting to web servers (http) to math (math) to file handling (os), minimizing the code you have to write from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Portable (Platform Independent): Write once, run anywhere. A Python script written on Windows will run on Linux or Mac without changes (provided the environment is set up)."
